A lot of that work happened in fast-moving startups where the goal was to ship, not to document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is an attempt to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-ill-write-about"&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ll write about&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ll cover sits at the intersection of &lt;strong&gt;research and production engineering&lt;/strong&gt;, the gap that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get enough attention. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://swappysh.github.io/about_me/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swappysh.github.io/about_me/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am an AI/ML engineer focused on building production LLM systems, multi-agent architectures, and evaluation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at Aleph, where I work on a semi-autonomous FP&amp;amp;A agent that helps finance teams reason over financial data, surface recommendations, and take actions with human approval workflows. My work spans agent capabilities, LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, and production reliability/performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, I was an AI Engineer / Senior AI Engineer at HippocraticAI, where I was part of the founding team and helped build the Polaris multi-agent system for safety-critical patient conversations. I worked on specialist agents, RAG/tool-calling, evaluation frameworks, and LLM fine-tuning, and helped scale the platform to 1M+ patient calls per week.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Saves</title><link>https://swappysh.github.io/saves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://swappysh.github.io/saves/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
