I am an AI/ML engineer focused on building production LLM systems, multi-agent architectures, and evaluation infrastructure.

I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at <span class="vim-hl">Aleph</span>, where I work on a semi-autonomous FP&A agent that helps finance teams reason over financial data, surface recommendations, and take actions with human approval workflows. My work spans agent capabilities, LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, and production reliability/performance improvements.

Before that, I was an AI Engineer / Senior AI Engineer at <span class="vim-hl">HippocraticAI</span>, where I was part of the founding team and helped build the Polaris multi-agent system for safety-critical patient conversations. I worked on specialist agents, RAG/tool-calling, evaluation frameworks, and LLM fine-tuning, and helped scale the platform to 1M+ patient calls per week.

Earlier, I worked at <span class="vim-hl">Microsoft</span> on code generation for JavaScript unit tests using OpenAI Codex, at <span class="vim-hl">Nference</span> on biomedical search and NLP systems, and at <span class="vim-hl">Zeta (Directi)</span> on high-throughput payments infrastructure.

I completed my MS in Computer Science at <span class="vim-hl">NYU</span>, where I worked on code generation and bias evaluation research with publications on arXiv.
