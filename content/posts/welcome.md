This is a starter post. Edit the front matter, add content, then remove `draft = true` to publish.

Quick tips:

- Put images in `static/images/` and reference as `/images/<name>.<ext>`.
- Keep paragraphs short; use headings for structure.
- Code example:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-next-post.md
```
