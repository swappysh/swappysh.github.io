I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at Aleph, where I work on a semi-autonomous FP&amp;A agent that helps finance teams reason over financial data, surface recommendations, and take actions with human approval workflows. My work spans agent capabilities, LLM-as-a-judge evaluations, and production reliability/performance improvements.
Before that, I was an AI Engineer / Senior AI Engineer at HippocraticAI, where I was part of the founding team and helped build the Polaris multi-agent system for safety-critical patient conversations. I worked on specialist agents, RAG/tool-calling, evaluation frameworks, and LLM fine-tuning, and helped scale the platform to 1M+ patient calls per week.
